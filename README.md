# Schoolhouse Skateboarder Game
Tap the screen to make the skateboarder jump avoiding obstacles and collect diamonds if possible. The longer you are in the game, the more points you gain.
This game is based on the book: "Swift for Kids: A Playful Introduction to Making iPhone and iPad Apps". 
I made the changes so that the code is up to date as of November 2021 (iOS 15.0.2).
